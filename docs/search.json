    "text": "What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nBoth fields work in data but have a different approach. Data Scientists tend to focus on computational analysis of the data and data modeling while Statisticians focus on topics such as inference and statistical theory.\n\nData Scientist: Machine Learning, Big Data, Data Engineering, Python and R, tend to work in tech companies (finance, marketing, healthcare)\nStatisticians: Theoretical foundations of statistical methods, experimental design, hypothesis testing, probability theory, tend to work in research (e.g., pharmaceuticals)."
